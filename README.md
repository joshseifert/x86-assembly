# x86-assembly

These are a couple simple programs I wrote for CS271 when learning Assembly language for x86 processors. 

randomArraySort creates an array, fills it with psuedo-random numbers, and returns basic statistics on the array to the user.
combinatorics quizzes the user on combinatorics math problems. 

These programs were intended mostly as an exercise on memory access, using the stack, procedure calls, and I/O. They were written during my second 
semester programming, so they may be a bit rough around the edges.
